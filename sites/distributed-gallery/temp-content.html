<h1>Fact</h1>
<p class="creator">Dworkin, Craig</p>
<p class="description">Fact is a self-reflexive, deconstructed meditation on the act of writing and of publishing, with an emphasis on the materiality of language. Each time Dworkin displays the poem, he researches the medium on which it's being viewed, changing the list of ingredients. It's a flexible work in progress, sometimes manifesting itself as a list of the ingredients that make up a Xerox copy, other times listing the composition of an lcd display monitor. Artist's bio: Craig Dworkin is the author of Dure (Cuneiform Press, 2004), Strand (Roof Books, 2005), and Parse (Atelos, 2008), among others. He teaches at the University of Utah. PDF-as-digital-video screened at Interrupt 3, March 12-15, 2015.</p>
