          <h1>The Digital Humanities in context of User-Centered Design (UCD).</h1>
          <p>Many scholars and educators utilize a traditional close, critical reading analysis strategy that attempts to analyze a literary text from a particular lens - such as historical, feminist/gender, archetypal, marxist, etc. This close critical reading technique tries to provide a unique reading of the text and generate distinct interpretations. By applying the User-Centered Design process to literary analysis, a digital technology text analysis interface can be created to serve similar functionality. However, each designed Digital Humanities Literature Analysis Interface (DHLAI) transforms the previously purely mental lens into a material, definitive analysis framework. The digital literary analysis design methodology this paper introduces allows the analyst to generate an original, unambiguous virtual text-interaction lens.</p>

          <p>As an engineering student pursuing biomedical engineering device design, the design process fundamentally impacts my perspective of the surrounding world. Each resource forges the possibility for an artfully developed user interaction experience. Ingenuity, methodical design experimentation, and user feedback can transform malleable raw materials into a successful product or service. The user-centered design process is a universally applicable system, simply providing a framework in which to investigate, create, implement, and reevaluate an idea. The design process presented in this paper stems from the core ideology of the design process, the scientific method, and traditional literary analysis. Integrating these individual methodologies and renovating the product to derive a process uniquely tailored to the Digital Humanities generates a unifying, creativity-fostering process. Formalizing this process endeavors to add efficacy to Digital Humanities literature analysis results, assist in unifying an incredibly diverse field of study, and provide Digital Humanists with a process guide to expedite the literary analysis process and produce replicable results.</p>

          <p>Although this process is intended to help standardized a currently unsystematic, rapidly developing field, it is also intended to be an organic, adaptable methodology. One of the primary advantages of the Digital Humanities is the diversity of analysis perspectives stimulated by its interdisciplinary foundation. This process is intended to cultivate the innovation, divergent exploration, and collaboration already defining this field. An open organization structure is often necessary to produce truly inspired results. Just as engineering design parameters limit product possibilities while simultaneously spurring brilliant out-of-the-box solutions, the Digital Humanities Literary Analysis Methodology is intended to assist Digital Humanists in simplifying research steps that are often more complicated than necessary to encourage a more productive text analysis experience.</p>

          <p>For each project, a Digital Humanities analyst designs an interface to be used to analyze a chose literary work or corpus of works. This Digital Humanities Literature Analysis Interface (DHLAI) is designed through the selection of diverse analysis components and will determine the analyst’s interaction with the chosen literary item. This text interface may be comprised of various existing DH tools, uniquely coded and designed DH tools, traditional literary analysis techniques, and any helpful tools from the incorporated fields.  The designed interface also controls the information, data, and results that the literary analysis will produce.As an evolutionary system, this design process benefits from experience, both in literary analysis project design and DH analysis tool functionality.</p>

          <p>Continuous Improvement methodology was initially developed to improve the quality and efficiency of manufacturing. The use of these tools, processes, and philosophies quickly spread to other fields, both emerging and historically-founded, growing to encompass improvements in innovation, improved user or customer experiences, and service expansion. For the Digital Humanities, continuous improvement functions as a way to help advance and mature the field as a whole. Continuous improvement can be used by Digital Humanities practitioners as a way to improve their personal skills, utilization of available analytical tools, and collaboration techniques, which will ultimately improve their abilities to design effective  literature analysis interfaces. Continuous improvement can also be focused on improving digital analysis tools.</p>
